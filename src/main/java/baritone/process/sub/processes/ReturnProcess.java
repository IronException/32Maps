    there might be a problem actually?
     -> where the fuck is the PathingCommand?

    it has to be defined where. rn it could be anywhere and the one that is on the lowest will be taken...

    okay so we have:
    - we need to return one for sure. no matter from where...
    - it could be the first one encountered in the series
    - it could be the last one?
    - maybe best is like this:


    - = command
    | = a return
    = = already executed

    =-|---|---
      ^ is first...

    ==|=--|---
      ^ this one should be taken

    ==|===|=--
          ^ that one

    = area is finished
    - area is !finished

    better one:
        normal: if (finished) { return next.getReturn(alt) } else { if (alt == null) { return next.getReturn(alt) } else { return alt } }
        return: if (finished) { return next.getReturn(this.generate()) } else { return this.generate() }


    how to do that?

    so getReturn() should give it when it has one
    when not it should get one from next
    -> that way it will always return the first one... so:


       normal: return null if not finished
       return: generate if null
